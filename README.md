# RestaurantRecommender_FemmeHacks
Envisioned and implemented a website employing HTML and CSS that collects data and sorts through a Documenu API to recommend users restaurants based on their region and cravings.
Predicted and prioritized user inputs and implemented relevant code for an interface, converting Python code to JavaScript using PHP and sys/Flask imports.
Ultimate goal was to limit and filter out risk-prone and irrelevant search options and provide immediate responses to users' inputs.
